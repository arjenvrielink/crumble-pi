crumble-pi
==========

Crumble-Pi is a multisensor framework to integrate the measuring experience of a field trip and the data analysis. The motto is: one crumble doesn't make a pie.

There is still a LOT to do on this project, so bear with us. But for the moment, clone us and run:::
> python bootstrap.py
> bin/buildout
> bin/runserver

And you're good to go.

You can also use the ``Vagrantfile`` and ``vagrant up`` if you like that sort of thing (we do).
